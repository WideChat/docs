## Project Ideas

### Service Accounts in Rocket.Chat

- **Mentors:** @karan.bedi, @bizzbyster
- **Description:** Adding the functionality of Service accounts to Rocket.Chat. A service account is an account owned by a User (owner), having basic profile (username, avatar, description etc.). If any other User (initiating user) creates a direct messages(DM) session with this service account, this chat session is carried to the owner of the service account. The owner can then reply to this chat session, but to the initiating user it would seem that the reply is coming from the service account. An authorised user should be able to create service accounts, transfer the ownership of the service account. Service accounts should be searchable, there should be a directory of service accounts. Also, users should be able to subscribe to service accounts, and a service account owner should be able to send broadcast messages to its subscribers. Automated tests should be written to cover the added functionality.
- **Desirable Skills:**  Familiarity with JavaScript development & Rocket.Chat code base

### Newsfeed

- **Mentors:** @bizzbyster, @karan.bedi
- **Description:** Adding the functionality of newsfeed, which is similar to a customised read-only channel for every user. Every user (follower) can follow other users (followed user). Posts from the followed user appears in the newsfeed of their followers. Posts are threaded discussions, started by the followed user in any public channel (origin channel), their follower can or cannot be a part of the origin channel but this post comes up in thier wall with a permalink to the orignal post in the origin channel. This helps in discovering new conversations. Interns are encouraged to propose entensions to this like wall, where a user can post threads that show up in thier follower's feed, status updates, etc. Automated tests should be written to cover the added functionality.
- **Desirable Skills:**  Familiarity with JavaScript development & Rocket.Chat code base

### Improved Test Automation in Rocket.Chat Repos

- **Mentors** @TBD
- **Description:** The goal of this project is to enhance the current test infrastructure in the RocketChat repos and pipelines.  Currently there is some very minimal junit testing that needs to be expanded, and no integration or system level tests, or infrastructure to support them.  This project could focus on one of the repos, possibly the Android code base, or all.  Once a test infrastructure and best practice is established, the goal is that no new code gets merged unless it has new tests that will be run at build time, and it passes all of the previous tests.

### Custom Notifications in Android

- **Mentors:** @TBD
- **Project repository**: <https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Android>
- **Description:** The web client currently has the flexibility of customizing the notifications per channel but the Android client lacks this feature. This project aims to bring this feature into the Android client. Users would be able to mute specific channels and configure if they want to receive notifications when they are mentioned or for every notification, etc. Snooze functionality can also be implemented as an extension of this project.
- **Desirable Skills:**  Familiarity with Android development, specifically the Rocket.Chat.Android code base.

### iOS Voice Over Accessibility

- **Mentors:** @TBD
- **Project repository**: <https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.iOS>
- **Description:** VoiceOver is a gesture-based screen reader that lets you enjoy using iPhone even if you donâ€™t see the screen. This is especially important for those with low or no vision. We want to make Rocket.Chat for everyone. A blind user should be able to easily add servers, change servers, read messages and send messages, as well as other additional functions such as editing profile and creating channels. Minimum acceptable scope is to be determined.
- **Desirable Skills:** We are looking for an undergraduate student who is familiar with team work, developing iOS Apps using UIKit and Swift, as well as writing maintainable code with Unit Tests and having some familiarity with Voice Over and Accessibility.

### Apple Watch & Siri Support

- **Mentors**: @TBD
- **Project repository**: <https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.iOS>
- **Description**: Create an Apple Watch application that replicates the most basic features we have in our iOS mobile client, such like viewing the chat rooms and reading the messages. Let user ask Siri to read latest messages, send messages or respond to a message.
- **Desirable Skills**: Familiarity with WatchKit development on WatchOS & SiriKit. Ability to work in large multi-disciplinary teams.
